## Contribute to the Documentation

This project uses `mkdocs` to publish its documentation.
Its content is entirely stored within markdown files (`.md`) in the `docs/` directory.
A Github workflow deploys automatically updated documentation after commits to the `main` branch.  
See the official [mkdocs documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/) for more details.

To view the documentation locally, install the documentation related packages and run the documentation server:
```sh
pip install -r requirements_docs.txt
mkdocs serve
```
